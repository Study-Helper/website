# Assignment 1 - Good and Bad Design

In this assignment, we explore examples of good and bad UI, focusing on what is done right and what should
be done differently.

## Examples of Good UI

### Circular Launchers

Launchers for Android phones represent, in my opinion, an effective implementation of an original UI concept. The point of
launchers (in general) is to customise your home screen, making it functional and personal, depending on your own preferences.

**Circular launchers**, in particular, embrace a very interesting area of the mobile world: the thumb zone.

#### What's good about them?

Circular launchers succeed because they simply *play nice* with your thumbs. No matter how you're using your device (left or right handed, using one or
two hands), these are specifically designed for usability; you won't ever need to stretch your fingers to reach certain elements,
which is a very common problem.

In his book *Designing for Touch*, writter Josh Clark has recorded in-depth information on [how people hold their devices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/), obtaining
the following results:

By focusing on the natural zone of the touchscreen, the circular launchers provide a very elegant solution to this common usability
issue, and thus represent a good, confortable user interface.


## Examples of Bad UI

### Complex (Digital) Forms

> Despite being one of the most important types of digital interaction, long/messy forms are often seen as very annoying.

Forms are a very difficult UI element to get right, especially when a lot of information is required. The responsible
developers should pay special attention to improving their forms and making them as usable as possible. At the end of the day, careful
design will have a huge impact on how fast and error-free the user provides the necessary information.

#### What are the problems?

When not carefully designed, different forms will suffer from different UI problems. The most common ones would be:

- **Multi-column layout:** Much more difficult to quickly scan the fields.
- **Wrong size of input fields:** The users may start to wonder if they correctly understood the label.
- **No Distinction between optional and required fields:** Specially for long forms, the less the user has to type, the better.

#### How can it be done better?

The most crucial (and arguably difficult) aspects of good form design come down to little visual cluttering, logical separation of
input fields and good hints/user-forgiving formatting. There have been several attempts at following these principles,
and I'd like to focus on one that I've stumbled across some time ago and find very unique. It's called [TypeForm](https://www.typeform.com):
