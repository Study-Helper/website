# Assignment 1 - Good and Bad Design

In this assignment, we explore examples of good and bad UI, focusing on what is done right and what should
be done differently.

## Examples of Good UI

### I. Circular Launchers

> Android launchers are apps that can spice up your phone's home screen (...) - [source](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/everything-you-need-to-know-about-android-launchers/)

Launchers for Android phones represent, in my opinion, an effective implementation of an original UI concept. The point of
launchers (in general) is to customise your home screen, making it functional and personal, depending on your own preferences.

**Circular launchers**, in particular, embrace a very interesting area of the mobile world: the thumb zone.

#### What's good about them?

Circular launchers succeed because they simply *play nice* with your thumbs. No matter how you're using your device (left or right handed, using one or
two hands), these are specifically designed for usability; you won't ever need to stretch your fingers to reach certain elements,
which is a very common problem.

In his book *Designing for Touch*, writer Josh Clark has recorded in-depth information on [how people hold their devices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/09/the-thumb-zone-designing-for-mobile-users/), obtaining
the following results:

By focusing on the natural zone of the touchscreen, the circular launchers provide a very elegant solution to this common usability
issue, and thus represent a good, comfortable user interface.

### II. Telegram

> A new era of messaging.

This application lets users exchange messages in a simple and effective way.

#### What's good about it?

Its interface allows the visualization of not only sent/received messages but also other relevant information for each message, such as its status or the remittee's name and photo.
It also offers a search bar and a menu with various other options.

From its qualities, the following stand out:
- The names of the users visually stand out from the rest of the information, making it easier
to differentiate them from the rest of the text, facilitating the reading.
- One can access relevant message metadata such as last activity time and status without having to explicitly open those messages
- The UI spreads really nicely through the application window, and the boundaries of each section are well defined via colour combinations and backgrounds.
- The highlight colour that stands out when the user clicks some chat and the name/photo of the user associated with that chat make it really easy to "stay in the zone" (i.e. when minimizing and coming back, the user knows where he left off).

## Examples of Bad UI

### I. Complex (Digital) Forms

> Despite being one of the most important types of digital interaction, long/messy forms are often seen as very annoying.

Forms are a very difficult UI element to get right, especially when a lot of information is required. The responsible
developers should pay special attention to improving their forms and making them as usable as possible. At the end of the day, careful
design will have a huge impact on how fast and error-free the user provides the necessary information.

#### What are the problems?

When not carefully designed, different forms will suffer from different UI problems. The most common ones would be:

- **Multi-column layout:** Much more difficult to quickly scan the fields.
- **Wrong size of input fields:** The users may start to wonder if they correctly understood the label.
- **No Distinction between optional and required fields:** Specially for long forms, the less the user has to type, the better.

#### How can it be done better?

The most crucial (and arguably difficult) aspects of good form design come down to little visual cluttering, logical separation of
input fields and good hints/user-forgiving formatting. There have been several attempts at following these principles,
and I'd like to focus on one that I've stumbled across some time ago and find very unique. It's called [TypeForm](https://www.typeform.com):

### II. RTP Play

This application allows users to follow live emissions of TV and radio, fully rewatch shows and access the RTP's programming. That being said, this interface's focus should be on letting the user search, filter and watch content with minimum effort.

#### What are the problems?

- The colour choice isn't the best, considering that the colour blue is the less perceptible one to the human eye. Specifically, in the case of menu, mixing various tones of blue makes the reading even more difficult.
- The second menu could have its size reduced (or be more space-efficient), reducing those two sub-menus (by channel and by theme) to checkboxes.
- The menu icon could change when the menu is open, making it more clear that clicking on it again the second menu would be toggled off again.
- The space taken by each item of the results is badly optimised.
